Everyone I speak to complains that the life is hard.

Agreed. Life is too much of suffering and only a bit of happinees.

But what do you mean when you say "hard" ?

I used to think, until recently, that "hard" means "unbearable" and we're not supposed to handle such a turmoil.

My perception has changed; life is hard (in a sense of being unbearable) only if you do not have sabr.

Do you know what sabr means ?
