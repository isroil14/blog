***

Truth is completely alien to the material world we live in. But at the same time we have an unrestricted access to it if we can be inline with it.

Allah is the Ultimate Truth. His words are truth.

- In the Name of Allah - the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.

- All praise is for Allah - Lord of all worlds,

- the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,

- Master of the Day of Judgment.

- You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help.

- Guide us along the Straight Path,

- the Path of those You have blessed - not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.

Quran, Al-Fatihah
